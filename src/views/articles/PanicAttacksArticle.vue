      <h2>What is a Panic Attack?</h2>
      <p>A panic attack is an intense surge of fear or extreme discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes. Symptoms can include heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, and feelings of impending doom.</p>

      <h2>Causes and Triggers</h2>
      <p>Panic attacks can be triggered by stress, certain medical conditions, or can occur unexpectedly. Research indicates that genetic factors may also play a role in the likelihood of experiencing panic attacks.</p>

      <h2>Coping Strategies</h2>
      <p>Effective coping strategies include deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, and cognitive-behavioral techniques. A study published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders (Lee et al., 2022) found that these methods can significantly reduce the frequency and intensity of panic attacks.</p>

      <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
      <p>If panic attacks are frequent or interfere with daily life, it is important to seek professional help. Therapy and medication can be effective treatments.</p>
